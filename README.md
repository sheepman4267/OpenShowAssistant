# OpenShow Assistant

This is a companion to OpenShow which will eventually manage display windows, moving/opening/closing them as required. It will provide a GUI interface useful for troubleshooting and configuring the local displaying of OpenShow "displays" in browser windows.

WIP- no functional code exists yet.
